# CrystalGame
Crystal Collector- number guessing game.

Upon game start, user will see a random number appear. 

The user will click the crystal pictures (all of which have their own random number) in an effort to have their score match the random number.

If their score matches, "You Win" appears and they receive a win.

If they go over the random number, "You Lose" appears and they receive a loss.

The game resets to a new random number and new random numbers for the crystals upon receipt of a win or a lose.
